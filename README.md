# Password-Manager-CCIT-Project-2
## Overview
This document presents the completed "Password Manager System" project, which demonstrates the practical implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations while incorporating essential cybersecurity principles. The system was developed using Python as the primary programming language and MySQL as the database management system, with MySQL Workbench serving as the development interface.

## Project Focus
The core objective of this project centers on implementing robust security measures for storing sensitive information, including:
- Website credentials
- URL management
- Private password storage

## Technical Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Database Management: MySQL
- Development Interface: MySQL Workbench
- Query Language: SQL

## Acknowledgments
We extend our sincere gratitude to the faculty members who provided mentorship and guidance throughout the development of this project. Their expertise and support were instrumental in bringing this system to completion.

## Learning Experience
While this project may contain certain imperfections, we view these as valuable learning opportunities that will inform and improve our future development endeavors. Each challenge encountered has contributed to our growth as developers and our understanding of secure system design.

## Documentation Scope
This comprehensive paper documents the entire development lifecycle, including:

- System flowchart design
- Complete source code implementation
- Database architecture and design
- Query optimization and database management processes

The documentation serves as both a technical reference and a learning resource, capturing the full scope of work involved in creating a secure password management system.
